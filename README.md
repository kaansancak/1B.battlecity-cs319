### Description of the Project

* In the project we are going to implement classic atari game "Battle City".
* Our aim is to create this game using the principles of object oriented programming.
* The game is implemented in Java by using JavaFX library.

### Description of the Battlecity

#### General:
It is a multiplayer game, where each user has control of their one tank. Player's objection is surviving until all other tanks are destroyed

#### Maps:
The edges (outer boundaries) of the maps are built by unbreakable square objects. In addition, there might be breakable squares inside the map.

#### Controls:
Each player has 4 different keys to control the movement of their tank and one key to fire. Up/ Down key to move forward/back, left/right key to move to the left/right and space bar for shooting. The direction of fire will depend on the last movement key used.

#### Gameplay:
The player will die if his/her tank is shot by another tank. Each tank has three lives. The bullets of tanks go in a straight line until they hit an object (wall or tank). Tanks do not pass through walls or each other. If a wall is breakable, the bullets will destroy it in certain amount of shots (depends on the wall type).
